# own-me
Buy, trade, sell, view and promote your hottest digital "assets" as NFTs. 18+ XXX.

## Features

A digital marketplace similar to OnlyFans where creators can sell NFT's of their provocative photos.

### Subscriptions

Users can pay in $NUDE monthly to subscribe to Creators profiles and see their private posts.
Subscriptions also contribute to your profiles ranking and you can gain awards and achievements.

### The Auction House 

Creators can mint limited edition NFTs and auction them off in the Auction House.

### The Candy Shop

A FREE marketing section where Creators can post free content / NFTs to market their main profiles and auctions.
It's like a teaser section. Sometimes limited edition "candies" NFTs will be posted in the Candy Shop.


### Private Chat with Creators

### What makes Own Me unique?

#### Encrypted NFT content.
Creators can choose to make their NFTs encrypted so only the true owner can view it. 
The only way to view the NFT is by logging in with your Own Me account and using your stored encryption keys to "unlock" the image.

#### More profits for creators.
The main competition OnlyFans charges: 20% on all transactions. 
We will charge 1% - 10% (to be decided), leaving much more profit for creators.

## The Token: $NUDE
Very simple typical ERC-20 token used for in-app transactions and NFT minting.

We think this is a great name and a great meme.
